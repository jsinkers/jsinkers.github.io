As a group of 3, we implemented a ground-up agent-based model of wealth inequality in Java, replicating a NetLogo model. We then extended the model to examine the effect of inheritance on wealth distribution. It was fascinating to observe the emergence of wealth inequality on the basis of a fairly simple model.
