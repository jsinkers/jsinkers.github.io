### Hybrid Agricultural Aircraft - Design project

Course Project for Aerospace Design, 2013

![P13A Hybrid agricultural aircraft](/images/aircraft-design.png)

An eight person, year-long team project assessing the feasibility of a hybrid-propulsion agricultural aircraft through ground-up prototype design. My personal contribution to this project involved formulation of requirements, development of the aircraft configuration and CAD modelling, the production of a model for wind tunnel testing, design and analysis of the hybrid-propulsion system, propeller design, flight dynamics, and landing gear design.
