Failure prediction of composite materials (e.g. carbon fibre reinforced polymers) is still not well understood,
requiring long and expensive test programs. Onset theory is a new composite failure theory based on strain invariants at the micromechanical level. In this project I applied onset theory to test specimens, examining variations in predictions and test
results with temperature. This required extensive lab tensile testing of coupons, microscopy, and analytical predictions.
