Personal project, 2019

This project explored computation using a register machine and learning about Vue and deployment. A register machine is a Turing-complete model of computation that's a bit easier to follow than a Turing
machine. The web-app gives some tutorials and allows you to solve challenges by writing
programs for the register machine. This project was implemented using Vue, with a client-side interpreter of the register machine programs, and was deployed using Heroku.
