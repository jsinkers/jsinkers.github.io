We conducted the world's largest on-road study of passing distance to date, collecting data from 162 cyclists in Victoria and Western Australia, producing over 46,000 passing events. In this publication we found that protected bicycle lanes are 10 times more effective than painted bicycle lanes, and that painted bicycle lanes are better than no bicycle lane at all.
